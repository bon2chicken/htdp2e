; Design inex*. The function multiplies two Inex representations of numbers,
; including inputs that force an additional increase of the outputâ€™s exponent.
; Like inex+, it must signal its own error if the result is out of range, not
; rely on create-inex to perform error checking.

; N Number N -> Inex
