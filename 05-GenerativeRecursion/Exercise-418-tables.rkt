; Exercise 418.
;
; A table is a structure of two fields: the natural number VL and a function
; array, which consumes natural numbers and, for those between 0 and VL
; (exclusive), produces answers.
;
; Since this data structure is somewhat unusual, it is critical to illustrate
; it with examples. [Here] table1â€™s array function is defined for more inputs
; than its length field allows; table2 is defined for just one input, namely 0.
; Finally, we also define a useful function (table-ref) for looking up values
; in tables.
;
; The root of a table t is the number in (table-array t) that is closest to 0.
; A root index is a natural number i such that (table-ref t i) is a root of
; table t.
;
; A table t is monotonically increasing if (table-ref t 0) is less then
; (table-ref t 1), (table-ref t 1) is less than (table-ref t 2), and so on.
;
; Design find-linear. The function consumes a monotonically increasing table
; and finds the smallest index for a root of the table. Use the structural
; recipe for N, proceeding from 0 through 1, 2, and so on to the array-length
; of the given table. This kind of root-finding process is often called a
; linear search.
;
