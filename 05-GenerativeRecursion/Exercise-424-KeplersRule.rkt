; Exercise 424.
;
; Kepler suggested a simple integration method. To compute a rough estimate of
; the area under f between a and b, proceed as follows:
;
; 1. divide the interval into half at mid = (a + b) / 2;
; 2. compute the areas of the two trapezoids, each determined by four points:
;
;        [(a,0),(a,f(a)),(mid,0),(mid,f(mid))]
;        [(mid,0),(mid,f(mid)),(b,0),(b,f(b))]
;
; 3.  then add the two areas.
;
; The method is known as Keplerâ€™s rule.
;
; Design the function integrate-kepler. That is, turn the mathematical
; knowledge into a ISL+ function. Make sure to adapt the test cases from
; figure 111 to this use. Which of the three tests fails and by how much?
;
; Domain knowledge Let us take a close look at the kind of trapezoids whose
; area you need to compute. Here are the two basic shapes, without a coordinate
; system to reduce clutter:
;
; (f L)                   - a similar shape with (f L) < (f R)
; |.                       
; |   .
; |       .               - area of both shapes can be calculated using         
; -------------(f R)        a single formula:
; |           |                  
; |           |             [(R-L) * f(R)] + [1/2 * (R-L) * ((f(L) - f(R))]
; |           |
; -------------           - which is equivalent to the formula:
; L           R                   [(R-L) * (f(L) + f(R))] / 2
;
