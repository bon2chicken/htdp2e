; 04.04 Sample Problem - Intervals - UFO Landing
; Design a program that simulates the descent of a UFO.
; 
; Requested Modification:
; Add a status line that says "descending" when the UFOâ€™s height is above one 
; third of the height of the canvas. It switches to "closing in" below that. 
; And finally, when the UFO has reached the bottom of the canvas, the status
; notifies the player that the UFO has "landed."
;
; Modified: main to call new 'render/status' function

; WorldState is a Number 
; interpretation: height of UFO (from top)

; constants: 
(define WIDTH  300)
(define HEIGHT 100)
(define CLOSE  (/ HEIGHT 3))

; visual constants: 
(define MT   (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define UFO  (overlay (circle 10 "solid" "green")          
                      (rectangle 40 2 "solid" "green")))
