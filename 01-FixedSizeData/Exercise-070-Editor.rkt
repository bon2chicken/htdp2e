; Exercise 70. 
; Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.
; The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of 
; 200 x 20 pixels. For the cursor, use a 1 x 20 red rectangle and for the 
; strings, black text of size 16.
;
;Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacketâ€™s interaction area. 
;We started with this expression:
;
;    (overlay/align "left" "center"
;                   (text "hello world" 11 'black)
;                   (empty-scene 200 20))
;
; You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions. When you are
; happy with the looks of the image, use the expression as a test and as a 
; guide to the design of render.
