; 04.04 Sample Problem - Intervals - UFO Landing
; Design a program that simulates the descent of a UFO.
; 
; Add a status line that says "descending" when the UFOâ€™s height is above one 
; third of the height of the canvas. It switches to "closing in" below that. 
; And finally, when the UFO has reached the bottom of the canvas, the status
; notifies the player that the UFO has "landed."
;
; REQUESTED MODIFICATION: position the status line at (20,20)
; 
; Modified: render/status 
;
; NOTE: the status line is cut-off as positioning uses middle of the text
;       string; ideally, need to store strings as constants of a fixed size
;       and position based on length

; WorldState is a Number 
; interpretation: height of UFO (from top)

; constants: 
(define WIDTH  300)
(define HEIGHT 100)
(define CLOSE  (/ HEIGHT 3))

; visual constants: 
(define MT   (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define UFO  (overlay (circle 10 "solid" "green")
                      (rectangle 40 2 "solid" "green")))

; WorldState -> WorldState
(define (main y0)  
  (big-bang y0           
            [on-tick nxt]            
            [to-draw render/status]))

; WorldState -> WorldState
; computes next location of UFO  
(check-expect (nxt 11) 14)

(define (nxt y)  (+ y 3))

; WorldState -> Image
; place UFO at given height into the center of MT 
(check-expect  (render 11) (place-image UFO (/ WIDTH 2) 11 MT)) 

(define (render y)  (place-image UFO (/ WIDTH 2) y MT))

; WorldState -> Image
; adds a status line to the scene created by render   
(check-expect (render/status 42)              
              (place-image (text "closing in" 11 "orange")            
                           20 20                           
                           (render 42)))

   (cond
     [(<= 0 y CLOSE) (text "descending" 11 "green")]                                             
     [(and (< CLOSE y) (<= y HEIGHT)) (text "closing in" 11 "orange")]
