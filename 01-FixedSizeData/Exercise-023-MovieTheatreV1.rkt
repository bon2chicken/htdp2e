; Our solution to the sample problem contains several constants in the middle 
; of functions. As One Program, Many Definitions already points out, it is 
; best to give names to such constants so that future readers understand where 
; these numbers come from. Collect all definitions in DrRacketâ€™s definitions 
; area and change them so that all magic numbers are refactored into constant
; definitions.

; Constants
(define AVG_ATTENDENCE    120)
(define BASE_TICKET_PRICE   5.0)
(define PEOPLE_SWING 15)
(define PRICE_VARIANCE 0.1)
(define FIXED_COSTS 180.0)
(define VARIABLE_COSTS 0.04)

; # of attendees is based on ticket price
(define (attendees ticket-price)  
  (- AVG_ATTENDENCE (* (- ticket-price BASE_TICKET_PRICE) 
                       (/ PEOPLE_SWING PRICE_VARIANCE))))

; revenue generated by ticket sales
(define (revenue ticket-price) 
  (* ticket-price (attendees ticket-price)))

; cost has a fixed part and a variable part based on the number of attendees
(define (cost ticket-price)  
  (+ FIXED_COSTS (* VARIABLE_COSTS (attendees ticket-price))))

; profit
(define (profit ticket-price) 
  (- (revenue ticket-price)

; example usage
