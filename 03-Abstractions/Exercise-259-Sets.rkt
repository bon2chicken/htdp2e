; Exercise 259. 
;
; Design a data representation for finite and infinite sets so that you can
; represent the sets of all odd numbers, all even numbers, all numbers 
; divisible by 10, etc. 
;
; Hint:  Mathematicians sometimes interpret sets as functions that consume a 
; potential element e and produce #true if the e belongs to the set and #false
; if it doesnâ€™t.
;
; Design the functions
;
;    add-element, which adds an element to a set;
;
;    union, which combines the elements of two sets; and
;
;    intersect, which collects all elements common to two sets;
;
; Keep in mind the analogy between sets and shapes.

; Set is a function:
;    [Number -> Boolean]
; interpretation: if s is a set and n is a number then (s n) produces
; #true if n is in s, #false otherwise

; example sets

; Set Number -> Boolean

; Number -> Set
; return #true if the number belongs to the set of even numbers
(check-expect (even-number 1) #false)
(check-expect (even-number 2) #true)

; return #true if the number belongs to the set of odd numbers

; return #true if the number belongs to the set of numbers 
; evenly divisible by ten
