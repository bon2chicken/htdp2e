; Exercise 192. 
; 
; Design the interactive program tetris-main, which displays blocks dropping 
; in a straight line from the top of the canvas and landing on the floor or 
; on blocks that are already resting. The input to tetris-main should 
; determine the rate at which the clock ticks. See the documentation of 
; on-tick for how to specify the rate.
;
; To discover whether a block landed, we suggest you drop it and check whether
; it is on the floor or it overlaps with one of the blocks on the list of 
; resting block. Hint Read up on the BSL+ primitive member?.
;
; When a block lands, your program should immediately create another block 
; that descends on the column to the right of the current one. If the current
; block is already in the right-most column, the next block should use the
; left-most one. Alternatively, define the function block-generate, which
; randomly selects a column different from the current one; see exercise 190 
; for inspiration.
