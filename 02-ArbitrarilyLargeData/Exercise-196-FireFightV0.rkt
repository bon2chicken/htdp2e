; Exercise 196. 
; 
; Design a fire-fighting game.
;
; The game is set in the western states where fires rage through vast forests.
; It simulates an airborne fire-fighting effort. Specifically, the player acts 
; as the pilot of an airplane that drops loads of water on fires on the ground.
; The player controls the planeâ€™s horizontal movements and the release of water
; loads.
;
; Your game software starts fires randomly anywhere on the ground. You may
; wish to limit the number of fires that may burn at any point in time, making 
; them a function of how many fires are currently burning. The purpose of the
; game is to extinguish all fires with a limited number of water drops.
;
; Use an iterative design approach as illustrated in this chapter to create
; this game.

; 1. Design basic graphics: plane, fire, trees, water
; 2. Establish a 'world' structure to hold elements
; 3. Create a 'render' function to draw the world
