; Exercise 313.
;
; Figure 77 presents a BSL parser for S-expressions. Specifically, the parse 
; function consumes an S-expr and produces an BSL-exprâ€”if and only if the 
; given S-expression is the result of quoting a BSL expression that has a
; BSL-expr representative.
;
; Create test cases for the parse function until DrRacket tells you that all
; expressions in the definitions area are covered during the test run.
;
; What is unusual about the definition of this program with respect to the
; design recipe? Note One unusual aspect is that the function uses length on
; the list argument. Real parsers do not use length because it slows the 
; functions down.
